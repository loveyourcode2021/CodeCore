lab2
Using data from this morning's lesson, write the following SQL Queries:

From the students table:

Select the first 10 students whose ages are between 35 and 45.
select * from students where ages >= 35 and ages <= 45 limit 10 offset 20;

Select the third set of 10 students whose ages are more than 25 and whose first names contain `le`. 
The students must be ordered by their id in ascending order then first name in a descending order.
select * from students where age > 25 and first_name ILIKE '%le%'limit 10 offset 20;

Select the 10 oldest students (You should ignore students with an age that is `NULL`).
Select all students with age 45 whose last names contain the letter n.
From the products table:

Select all the products that are on sale.
Select all the products that are on sale and have remaining items in stock ordered by the sale price in ascending order.
Select all the products priced between 25 and 50 (regular price) and that are on sale.
